# danvega.dev templates

When I first put my new site together It was just thrown together with a CSS framework called Bulma. This is my attempt at starting fresh from the ground up using plain old HTML & CSS. This tutorial is all about how I created the about page from scratch and walked you through my process. I hope this helpful for someone building their own web pages.
